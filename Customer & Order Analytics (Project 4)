-- Here, I am using SQL to look at a multi-table database, and draw out some of the key customer and order data.

-- 1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%iphone%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON order_id = orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT MIN(price), Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? Using number of products and price to determine revenue.

SELECT distinct Product, ROUND(SUM (Quantity*price), 2) AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT *
From BIT_DB.FebSales
LIMIT 20;

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Number_Sold, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
WHERE Feb.location LIKE '%548 Lincoln%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT (cust.acctnum) AS Customers, ROUND(AVG(Feb.Quantity*Feb.price), 2) AS Avg_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
RIGHT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(Feb.orderid) = 6
AND Feb.orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Number_Sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Number_Sold ASC;

-- 9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT location, COUNT (orderID) as Amount_of_Orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
AND length(Jan.orderid) = 6
AND Jan.orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3
ORDER BY Amount_of_Orders;

-- 10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as Amount
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Amount DESC;

-- 11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT ROUND((SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)), 2) AS Feb_avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(Quantity), 2) AS Feb_avg_amount
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

-- 13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity*price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
